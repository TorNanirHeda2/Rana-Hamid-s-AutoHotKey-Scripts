# Rana-Hamid's-AutoHotKey-Scripts
This is a Repository for all the AutoHotKey Script that Rana Hamid uses personally.

First of all, I absolutely don't have time to explain what does what. You gotta figure this out on your own. If you can't, but really really want to use my codes, knock me on Discord.

If you've never used AutoHotKey before, then it would be a good idea not to use any of my scripts. Learn how to use AutoHotKey first. Then you'll understand yourself what does what. Good Luck!

Might make a video about AutoHotKey one day.
